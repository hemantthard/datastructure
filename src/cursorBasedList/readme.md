CURSOR implementation is nothing but the linked list representation using Array as structure. So that means instead of pointing towards the next node, it stores the index position of the next element on the array.


TODO.. 
1. __reshuffle function. This will be an attempt on array to resieze, trying to remove the space of the element that was previously deleted. 
2. Performance check and Jasmine test.
